**Prasanna (Sonny) Tambe** is an Associate Professor in the [OID group](http://oid.wharton.upenn.edu) at the [Wharton School](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu) at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu). 

His research focuses on the economics of technology and labor. He is also interested in the use of data science tools for HR analytics. Much of this research uses Internet-scale data sources to measure skills and labor market activity at new levels of granularity. His published papers have analyzed data from online job sites, career platforms, and other labor market intermediaries that collect fine-grained information on workers’ skills and career paths and on employers’ job requirements. 

He is a co-author of “The Talent Equation: Big Data Lessons for Navigating the Skills Gap and Building a Competitive Workforce,” published by McGraw Hill in 2013.
