I am an Associate Professor in the [OID group](http://oid.wharton.upenn.edu) at the [Wharton School](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu) at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu).

[My official Wharton website](https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/tambe/).

I have two primary streams of [research](papers):

- **Economics of technical (IT) labor markets**: I am interested in the market for software developers, and how characteristics of this market affect employment and innovation outcomes.

- **Algorithms and hiring**: I study how new, digital algorithms and data signals are being used for hiring.
