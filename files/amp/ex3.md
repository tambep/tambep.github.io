### Prasanna Tambe

1. Spend 10 minutes answering the following questions.
-	Choose an industry in which you are interested.
-	What is one critical job that defines production in your chosen industry? 
-	What is the value proposition for adding AI into that job’s workflow?


2. Spend 15 minutes answering the following questions:
-	What needs to be done to redesign the workflow around AI tools?
-	How would AI tools work with these (human) workers?
-	What safeguards would need to be added into the process?
-	What are the benefits of integrating AI into this process?


What are the biggest implementation challenges to anticipate? For example:
- Data collection and privacy concerns?
- Biased decision-making?
- The costs of job transformation?
- Potential liability concerns?
- Regulatory uncertainty?
- Other things?


3. Spend 10 minutes answering the following questions:
- Write a new job ad for this job. 
- How would you redesign it for using AI tools? 
- What types of skills would you eliminate - which would you add? 
- What “soft” skills could become more important?


4. Finally, spend 5 minutes revisiting your answer above:
- What adjustments might you make to the above with an eye towards ensuring that it is ethical and fair with regards to workers? 
- How might AI integration affect worker well-being in your work context?
